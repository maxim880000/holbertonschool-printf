.SH NAME
_printf \- produce formatted output to standard output
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include "main.h"
.sp
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fB_printf\fR function produces output according to a format string and writes it to
\fBstdout\fR, the standard output stream.

The \fIformat\fR string may contain ordinary characters and conversion specifications
introduced by the \fB%\fR character.

This implementation handles only the following conversion specifiers:
.TP
.B c
Prints a single character.
.TP
.B s
Prints a string. If the argument is \fBNULL\fR, the string \fB"(null)"\fR is printed.
.TP
.B %
Prints a literal \fB%\fR character.
.TP
.B d, i
Prints a signed decimal integer. Negative numbers are correctly handled.

Flag characters, field width, precision, and length modifiers are \fBnot\fR supported.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, the total number of characters printed is returned
(the terminating null byte is not counted).

On error (in particular if \fIformat\fR is \fBNULL\fR), \fB\-1\fR is returned.
.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
_printf("Hello %s!\\n", "world");      \fR→\fP Hello world!
_printf("Character: %c\\n", 'X');      \fR→\fP Character: X
_printf("Percent: %%\\n");             \fR→\fP Percent: %
_printf("Negative: %d\\n", -123);      \fR→\fP Negative: -123
_printf("%s %c %d %%\\n", "test", 'A', 42);
        \fR→\fP test A 42 %
